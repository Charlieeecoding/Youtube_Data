# Youtube_Data

This is a project for learning API, Python, SQL, Azure, Power Bi all in one. Although I cannot upload everything into GitHub, screenshots may help for showing my work. 

Hope you will enjoy while you are reading, thank you!! 

Details of this project: 
I am trying to get the channel information from Youtube by calling the Youtube API, and gather data about the channel - NFL by using Python. I may do little data cleaning before saving as a CSV file for bettering reviewing and understanding on the data set. 

After saving as a CSV file, it will be imported to the Microsoft SQL database (MSSQL). 

Then, I will perform a migration from on-prem SQL database to Cloud database - Azure. (Or simply just connect between the on-prem database and the cloud database) 
  Created data pipeline in Azure data factory

Between each step of ETL, datasets will be store in Azure Data Lake Gen2

ETL will be performed in Azure DataBrick to analyze the data 

At last, Power Bi will be used for presenting the data from Azure, and just to show some insights and reporting the summary of the Youtube channel - NFL.
